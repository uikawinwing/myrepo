# Creative Workshop Client Release SOP

Creative Workshop has two independent version identities:

1. **SillyTavern client version** — the version embedded in the TavernHelper/Creative Workshop client script.
2. **Worker/web build identity** — exact Git SHA + Cloudflare Worker Version ID.

Do not use client SemVer to identify Worker/web-only changes.

## The deciding question

Before changing any Creative Workshop client version, ask:

> Does this change require a SillyTavern user to change the `@version` in their Creative Workshop import in order to receive the fix/feature?

- **No** → do **not** change client SemVer.
  - Examples: Worker logic, web UI, copy, CSS, ranking, admin UI, D1/R2/backend logic, server-side validation.
  - Track the release by Git SHA and Worker Version ID.
- **Yes** → a client release is required.
  - Bugfix to the client artifact → patch.
  - New backwards-compatible client capability → minor.
  - Incompatible client/bridge contract → major.

## Single source of truth

All current client release values live only in `config/workshop.json`:

- `client.stable`
- `client.minimum`
- `client.staging`
- `client.publicPath`
- `client.stagingPublicPath`
- `client.migrations`

Code, UI, build scripts and tests must reference that manifest; they must not repeat current version numbers or public bundle paths.

### Meaning

- `stable`: newest released client tag.
- `minimum`: oldest client allowed to enter the Workshop.
- `staging`: active staging-client build line.

A new stable release does **not** automatically require raising `minimum`.

Example:

```json
{
  "stable": "3.4.2",
  "minimum": "3.4.1",
  "staging": "3.5.0-dev"
}
```

In that example, users on 3.4.1 may continue using the Workshop without a forced-update popup.

## Server-only release

```text
change Worker/web code
→ tests
→ origin/staging
→ staging Worker exact SHA
→ acceptance
→ owner PR/main
→ production Worker exact SHA
→ report Git SHA + Worker Version
→ client version unchanged
```

## Client release

```text
client-side change requires new import @version
→ update config/workshop.json once
→ run pnpm check:workshop-config
→ build both client bundles
→ verify bundle-reported versions
→ staging validation
→ owner PR/main
→ create immutable release tag
→ deploy production Worker if needed
→ verify stable/minimum/staging values from manifest
```

### Legacy import-path migration

When a released client moves its public bundle path, keep the real client bundle only at `client.publicPath`. If backward compatibility is needed, `client.legacyShimPath` may contain one small self-rewrite migration shim generated from the manifest. It is not a second Workshop distribution. The shim must update the current TavernHelper script in place and must not duplicate the full client bundle.

## Mandatory reporting

Every release/status report must state these separately:

```text
Client stable: x.y.z
Client minimum: x.y.z
Client staging: x.y.z-dev
Git source: <sha>
Worker Version: <cloudflare-version-id>
```

Never say only “version updated” or “staging updated”.
